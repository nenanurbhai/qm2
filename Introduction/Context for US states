Massachusetts: 

Recently, researchers at Harvard Law School undertook a research project on racial and ethnic disparities in the Massachusetts Criminal Justice System (Bishop, Hopkins, Obiofuma, Owusu 2020). It is telling that this was carried out at the request of Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Chief Justice Ralph Gants who ‘expressed the need to take “a hard look at how we can better fulfill our promise to provide equal justice for every litigant”’ (Bishop, Hopkins, Obiofuma, Owusu 2020). When trying to gather data to approach this question Hopkins commented on the difficulties they faced as ‘[f]or instance, we were unable to get data from prosecutors’ offices or obtain sufficient data from police and law enforcement’ (Sanchez, 2020). Therefore, this was a key factor to observe when analysing our data sets, which perhaps do not show the whole picture. The study found that "White people make up roughly 74% of the Massachusetts population while accounting for 58.7% of cases in our data. Meanwhile, Black people make up just 6.5% of the Massachusetts population and account for 17.1% of cases. Latinx people are similarly overrepresented, making up 8.7% of the Massachusetts population but 18.3% of the cases in the sample." (Bishop, Hopkins, Obiofuma, Owusu 2020). The focus was on sentencing length and their analysis ‘shows that one factor—racial and ethnic differences in the type and severity of initial charge—accounts for over 70 percent of the disparities in sentence length’ (Bishop, Hopkins, Obiofuma, Owusu 2020). Issues also arose with defining and combining race and ethnicity data as ‘the Trial Court uses separate categories to denote race and ethnicity’ (Bishop, Hopkins, Obiofuma, Owusu 2020), while the ‘Department of Criminal Justice Information Services uses a single category to describe race and ethnicity jointly’ (Bishop, Hopkins, Obiofuma and Owusu 2020).

FLORIDA: 

A research report on ‘Unequal Treatment: Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Miami-Dade Criminal Justice’ found that ‘Racial and ethnic disparities occur at all decision points in the criminal justice system and across all neighbourhoods in Miami-Dade’ (Petersen and Omori, 2018). ‘In the state of Florida, 48 percent of the state’s prison population is Black, compared with 16.8 percent of the overall population’(Petersen and Omori, 2018), as shown in the table below: 


This discrimination spreads across all aspects of the criminal justice system from ‘arrest, pretrial detention, conviction and incarceration across the board for defendants arrested in Black neighborhoods in Miami-Dade County’ (June, 2020). Despite ‘82% of Florida voters agreeing that the criminal justice system is in need of reform’ (June, 2020), the ‘House leadership has resisted any real reform’ (June, 2020).
